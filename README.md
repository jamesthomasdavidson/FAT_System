# FAT_System
CSC 360 A3

This assigment can be downloaded using the zip.

unzip the assignment and type "make shell" in terminal.

run the program by entering in ./diskshell.  you can run an optional arguement for the img file,
default img file is in img1/disk1.img.

commands are:

list - will list out contents of root directory
info - will list out Superblock and FAT info
copytoimg - will copy file from working directory onto img file
copytolocal - will copy file from img to working directory
quit - will exit the program

This program has the framework layed down to implement different directories and directory navigation
on the img file.  I didn't finish it however, but it is there.

PS Dont understand why the spacing and indentation is really weird, everything was converted to spaces before upload.

Enjoy!
